## Repo Guidelines 

### File Naming Conventions

- Name your file after the feature it addresses
- Append the version of the file to the end of the name
- Examples: thrust_control.v2.slx, skeleton_body.v4.slx


### Commits

- Name your commits with vA.B.C, as follows:
- A: Major version update number, needs to be consistent with the file version
- B: Minor version update
- C: Very minor version update
- Example: update v2.8.1
- If you made any substantial changes or resolved errors, make sure to note this in your commit message as well
- **Do not commit to main**


### Pull Requests

When you’re ready to merge your branch to main, create a pull request and ping Hannah via Slack. 



### Folders

Note that there are initially empty files in the folders created. Please remove them once you have added files to the folder.
